The APL (Apache License) applies to churro itself, you can do what you want with the 
churro source code essentially as with any other APL licensed source
code.

The BSL exists to restrict others outside of churrodata.com to run
a churro-as-a-service commercial offering using the churro source code as
the basis of that offering.  Companies wanting to base commercial products
off of churro would need to obtain permission from churrodata.com.

Since churro deploys databases, depending on what database you deploy (cockroachdb, singlestore, and mysql)
the relevant licenses for those databases will apply, their
associated licenses are included in this repo under the licenses folder.

churro is built with various open source libraries, of which their respective
licenses are included in the licenses folder.
